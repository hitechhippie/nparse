## Nomns' Parser fork for TAKP

Provides player location and spell tracking support for TAKP by reading the player log.

Supports selection of specific character log files to support multiboxing on TAKP.  Each nParse instance icon on your system tray will have a tooltip which indicates the character being tracked/parsed for the given nParse instance.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/hitechhippie/nparse/wiki) for more information or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/hitechhippie/nparse/releases) for the latest release.
